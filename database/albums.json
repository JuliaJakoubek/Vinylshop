        "description": "“Introvert” is an expansive piece of music that begins with a mighty orchestral fanfare and doesn’t let up as Simz peels off bars that grapple with fear, frustration, and possibility on both a personal and more universal level. “My speech ain’t involuntary,” Simz raps, “Project with intention straight from my lungs/I’m a black woman and I’m proud one/We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome/But as long as we unified then we’ve already won.” Sometimes I Might Be Introvert follows Little Simz’s 2019 album, Grey Area. Simz produced the album with her regular collaborator Inflo, and it will feature guest appearances from Cleo Sol, Obongjayar, and even The Crown star Emma Corrin.",
